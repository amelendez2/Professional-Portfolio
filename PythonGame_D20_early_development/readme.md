Welcome to the Wonderful World of Python Development
==========

This project is a game in Early Development
-----------------

### Quick Introduction
	I wanted to make a game using primarily python with a MongoDB database.
	This project is still in development and what you see here is mostly the back end programming.
	I am currently developing the GUI, rather than having a purely command line game. This is one of a few
	projects that I am currently developing. The "end game," pun intended, is to create a crossplatform application
	that will run in Windows/ Linux as well as a Web based version. Additionally, I will be porting the program over to both
	IOS and Android. I'm in no rush to finish this program as it is mostly for fun and isn't really to make money. I enjoy programming
	and am passionate about learning new technologies. If you are reading this hopefully you enjoy the content that I have to show you
	and will consider me. Thank you for your time.
