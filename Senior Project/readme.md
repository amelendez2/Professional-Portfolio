Senior Capstone Project
==========

Active Cardiovascular System (Smart Jump rope)
-----------------

### Programming Languages: Java, C++, Python
### Applications: MATLAB, OrCAD, Android Studio, Arduino, Eclipse

## Quick Introduction
	This Project was my capstone group project that I developed, for which I received
	an A, during my senior year. The project is a fitness device (jump rope) that will
	take the user's heart rate via am Electrocardiogram(ECG) and transmit that data to 
	the jump rope and change the rope's color based on the user's current heart rate.
	My portion of the project was to design the initial ECG, prior to frequency filtering,
	program the Microcontroller, create an Android application, and test the functionality
	of each module leading up to the final design. Specifically we used an Intel Edison
	as the on board Bluetooth Low Energy antenna was an added bonus to the other specifications 
	that we would be using.
	
## Shortcomings
	With all projects there were setbacks during the development of this device. Our initial design
	unfortunately would not be feasible, as we wanted to create an accurate device. However, we shifted
	our focus and design and we were able to create a working device that was accurate to within
	the desired beats per minute (bpm). Also, due to the lack of time and from direction of our Professor,
	we abandoned the final functionality of the app. However, I included it here because I was able to enable
	the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi direct functionality; as well as some of the more basic functionality and style.
